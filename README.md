# Petclinic-backend

This project was carried out as part of the advanced web development course at the Haute Ã©cole en Hainaut. It aims to discover the Spring framework and follow a good programming architecture. This project can therefore be improved and completed with other features.

This is the backend version of the Spring petclinic application. 
This only provides a REST API so, **there's no UI.** 

UI application which consumes the REST API is here [Petclinic-Frontend](https://github.com/xorob0/Petclinic-Frontend).

# Available features
